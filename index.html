		<h1>Activity D7</h1>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Michael McGehee. I am 22 years old and am a Computer Science major. I love learning how to program and programming in general.</p>
		<h2>My projects</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I have started work on a Pokemon game simulator.</li>
			<li>I made a Quarterback rating calculator to calculate how good a quarterback is.</li>
			<li>I made a decay/exponential growth calculator for my math class last semester.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>My work experience</h2>
		<p>I currently do not have any work experience with programming, but that is soon to change. Later this year I will start applying to places to intern so that I can further my knowledge and experience with coding.</p>
